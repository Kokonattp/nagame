# Live search worker

Flight prices, train fares, restaurants, stays, shops and sights are checked live (owner decisions 2026-10-13): Tabi
sends only the destination + dates (the trip's own, else the 10th of the month asked about), or the
area + dish, to this worker. Jev UltraFast opens Google Flights / Google Maps in a normal Chrome,
the page's own results are read (nothing generated), and Tabi answers with "ทาบิเพิ่งเช็ก…".
When the worker is busy, over its cap, blocked or down, Tabi quietly answers from the published
snapshots / guide instead. The cheapest-dates calendar still uses its daily snapshot.

- **Off by default.** Live checks run only when Vercel has `LIVE_SEARCH_URL` and `LIVE_SEARCH_TOKEN`.
- **Search only.** No sign-in, no booking. A block or CAPTCHA page ends the search (HTTP 503);
  Tabi then shows the Google link instead. Do **not** point it at a browser service that solves
  CAPTCHAs (Browser Use Cloud does, always) — project rule.
- **Bounded.** One search at a time (others queue up to 15 s, then get "busy"), `LIVE_DAILY_CAP` searches a day
  (default 100), results cached in memory (flights 6 h, restaurants 30 days).
- Tested: Sasebo ramen 3.4 s, Bangkok ⇄ Sendai 7.4 s, Bangkok ⇄ Tokyo 7.6 s, cache hit 0.06 s.

## Endpoints
```
GET  /health                                   {"ok": true, "usedToday": 3, "cap": 100}
POST /search   Authorization: Bearer <token>
     {"kind":"flight","to":"Sendai","depart":"2026-12-10","back":"2026-12-15"}
     {"kind":"eat","area":"Sasebo","what":"ramen"}
```

## Run on the owner's PC (PowerShell)
```powershell
cd D:\TT\nagame
# Chrome with the worker's own profile
& "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9224 --user-data-dir=D:\TT\nagame-workers\chrome-cdp-profile --no-first-run about:blank
$env:LIVE_SEARCH_TOKEN = "<a long random string>"
uv run --project D:\TT\nagame-workers\jev-ultrafast --env-file .env.local python workers/live-search/server.py
```
The site can only reach it through a tunnel (e.g. `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8790`),
and only while the PC is on.

## Run on a small cloud machine (Docker)
`Dockerfile` = Google Chrome on a virtual display + Jev UltraFast (pinned commit) + `server.py`.
Any Docker host works (Fly.io, Railway, Runpod CPU). Example with Fly.io:
```powershell
cd D:\TT\nagame
fly launch --no-deploy --dockerfile workers/live-search/Dockerfile --internal-port 8790
fly secrets set LIVE_SEARCH_TOKEN=<random> TYPESAFE_API_KEY=<key>
fly deploy
```
Then in Vercel (Production): `LIVE_SEARCH_URL=https://<app>.fly.dev` and the same `LIVE_SEARCH_TOKEN`.

A cloud machine has a data-centre IP, so Google may show "unusual traffic" more often than at
home; the worker stops on that and Tabi falls back to the link. Do not add proxies or anything
that disguises the browser to get around it.
